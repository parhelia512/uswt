Building micro-swt
------------------

Thanks for trying micro-swt.  The build system is quite rough at this
point, so it's not for the inexperienced, but hopefully the following
should help you get it working.  Note that you must already have
micro-libgcj built and installed before proceeding.  Here we assume
you've installed it under /usr/local/gcc-ulibgcj.

The current build system consists of a makefile and a Perl script
which generates dependencies based on the selected platform.
Supported platforms are listed below.

  lin64   (Linux/AMD64)
  lin32   (Linux/i386)
  osxppc  (OS X/PowerPC)
  osxi386 (OS X/i386)
  win32   (Windows/i386)

For example, to build the library on a Linux/AMD64 machine, use the
following:

 $ make lin64=1

That should ultimately produce a file at build/lin64/swt.a, plus a
number of classes residing under build/lin64/classes/.  To compile and
link against these files, use something like the following:

 $ /usr/local/gcc-ulibgcj/bin/gcj -L/usr/local/gcc-ulibgcj/lib \
     -Wall -Os -g -fPIC --classpath=build/lin64/classes \
		--main=Hello test/Hello.java build/lin64/swt.a \
    $(pkg-config --libs-only-L cairo) -lcairo \
    $(pkg-config --libs-only-L gtk+-2.0 gthread-2.0) \
    -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgthread-2.0 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXtst \
    $(pkg-config --libs-only-L atk gtk+-2.0) -latk-1.0 -lgtk-x11-2.0 \
    -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU -lm -o build/lin64/hello

See the makefile for other examples, including platform-specific build
flags.  Those examples can be built as follows.

 $ make lin64=1 hello example graphics paint

Please note that you will need to edit the makefile by hand in some
cases based on your system configuration, unless it happens to match
mine exactly :).  Eventually, we'd like to adopt an automatic
configuration system using something like autoconf, but we haven't
reached that point yet.

Please also note that the makefile is currently set up to build the
win32 port via cross-development tools (ex. on a Linux host).  If you
wish to compile it on a Windows machine, you'll need to modify the
makefile accordingly.
